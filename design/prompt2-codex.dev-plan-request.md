In the .\design folder you can find the full design of a Neural RAG Database (NRDB) named Sphana.
Read the prompt request and response carefully, and understand what I want to create.
In short, I want you to develop for me 2 services:
1. In Python a command line service to train models and export them in ONNX format.
2. In .NET Core a service offers a gRPC API to index documents and query the database based on free text.
First I want you to write for me a full development plan in .\design\prompt2-codex.dev-plan-response.md file.
